# FocusPoint: Smarter Image Cropping for SilverStripe

The goal of this module is to introduce some basic art direction to control how images are cropped in SilverStripe.

**Problem:** SilverStripe crops all images from the centre. If the subject is off-centre, it may be cropped out.

**Solution:** FocusPoint allows you to tag the subject in an image and ensures it is not lost during cropping.
