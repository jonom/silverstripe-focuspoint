The goal of this module is to introduce some basic art direction to control how images are cropped in Silverstripe.

**Problem:** Silverstripe crops all images from the centre. If the subject is off-centre, it may be cropped out.

**Solution:** FocusPoint allows you to tag the subject in an image and ensures it is not lost during cropping.
